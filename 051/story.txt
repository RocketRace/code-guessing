 Let's go on a journey.

 82,712 lines- wait, only 4,429 lines long!
 
 But what's it all for?
 
 Why need 4,429 lines?
 
 Well, let me tell you.
 
 So I use this esolang
 named swift.
 
 In swift, I can find
 the length of a string
 very easily.
 
 (Whoops, mind the ASCII!) 
 
 But as I was saying.
 
 Swift.
 
 In swift, finding the
 length of a string is
 as easy as writing
 `string.count`.
 
 Isn't that nice?
 
 So I thought naively,
 "I'm sure it'll be as
 easy in Python, too!"
 
 But alas!
 
 It turns out that
 Python doesn't have
 any builtin way to
 get a string length?!
 
 Like, seriously!
 
 I can approximate the
 result with `len(string)`,
 but that's not quite right!
 
 `len("ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶")` gives
 the result of 2,
 for example, but
 the answer is 1!
 
 That's really weird.
 
 So I thought,
 "Well if it's
 not here in the 
 standard library,
 then I guess I'll
 have to write it
 myself."
 
 And so I did!
 
 That's what we've
 been scrolling along
 this whole time.
 
 This program finds
 the length of a string.
 
 It's a little verbose,
 but I think the code
 itself is pretty clear.
 
 What do you think?
 
 If you're a fan of it,
 comment below with
 "BIG fan!! <3"
 
 If you for some reason
 are not a fan, comment
 with "not a fan... :/"
 
 But of course, you
 wouldn't write that.
 
 So it's unnecessary
 for me to say.
 
 Nice weather outside,
 eh?
 
 Have you gone outside
 recently? 
 
 I went for a barbie
 the other day.
 
 Fantastic.
 
 Also, and this just
 popped into my head,
 have you heard of
 this game called
 "Undertale"?
 
 It's pretty cool.
 
 You should play it!
 
 I think my favorite
 character is, uh,
 
 What's-his-name...
 
 Sans undertale!
